    <h3>The Games</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            A game organizer designs and facilitates an <i>In Common</i> game until its conclusion. Currently there is a 'Match or 'Test' game type to choose from (More to come). Players receive a game code from the organizer and answer a series of questions designed by the organizer. The game is automatically officiated by <i>In Common</i> based on the specific rules of the game type. When the game is completed, results can be made available directly to a player's device. Extra reports are available to the organizer on the <i>In Common</i> portal.
