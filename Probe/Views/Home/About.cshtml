            All a game organizer needs to do is register (for free) on the Probe portal. FaceBook or Google accounts can be used to register and avoid dealing with another password.
            <p>

            The game is especially mobile friendly. The Probe mobile app can be installed from the Apple and Google Play stores. It can also be played (without install) by using your mobile browser.
            </p>
            A game requires all players to answer a series of questions designed by the organizer and is contested by the specific rules of the game type. Current game types available are 'Match' and 'Test'. More to come. When games are completed, the user can make results (reports) available to all players on their devices.
